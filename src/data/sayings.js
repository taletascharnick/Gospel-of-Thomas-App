    text: 'These are the hidden sayings that the living Jesus spoke, and which Didymos Judas Thomas wrote down. And he said: Whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will not taste death.',
    reflection: `The Gospel of Thomas opens not with a narrative but with a declaration of stakes: whoever finds the interpretation of these sayings will not taste death. This is the invitation — and also the warning — for what follows demands interpretation, not mere reading.

The word "hidden" does not mean deliberately withheld. It means concealed within, like a seed inside a fruit. These sayings have a surface and a depth. Most of us spend our lives on the surface.

The phrase "the living Jesus" is significant. The text presents these as the words of one who is alive — not a past teacher but a present reality. This invites us to read not as scholars of history but as people listening for a voice that speaks into this moment.

"Will not taste death" resonates through mystical traditions worldwide. It points not to physical immortality but to a shift in identification — from the mortal, constructed self to something deeper that was never born and will never die. The promise is not escape from physical death but freedom from the tyranny of it.`,

    text: 'Jesus said: Let the one who seeks not stop seeking until they find. When they find, they will be troubled. When they are troubled, they will marvel — and they will reign over all.',
    reflection: `This saying maps the spiritual journey with extraordinary honesty: seek → find → be troubled → marvel → reign. Notice that the path passes directly through trouble before arriving at wonder. This is crucially different from traditions that promise only comfort.

What troubles us? The things we genuinely find when we seek with openness. We find that our sense of who we are is more constructed, more fragile, more borrowed from others than we thought. We find that certainties we relied on dissolve under scrutiny.

But the saying does not stop at trouble. Through trouble comes marvel — the awe of encountering something vastly larger than the self we thought we were. And through marvel comes what the text calls "reigning over all." This is not power over others. It is sovereignty: the settled freedom of one who has found what cannot be taken.

The sequence matters. Do not skip the trouble. Do not protect yourself from the finding that disturbs you. The text suggests this is exactly where the path narrows to what you are truly seeking.`,

    text: "Jesus said: If your leaders say to you, 'The Kingdom is in the sky,' then the birds will get there before you. If they say, 'It is in the sea,' then the fish will arrive first. No — the Kingdom is within you and it is around you. When you know yourselves, you will be known, and you will understand that you are children of the living Father. But if you do not know yourselves, you live in poverty — and you are that poverty.",
    reflection: `Perhaps no single saying in the Gospel of Thomas is more foundational than this one. It directly challenges the most common spiritual strategy there is: looking outward for what can only be found inward.

The Kingdom is not a place to travel to, not a future state to wait for, not a reward to earn. The Kingdom is here, now, within and around us — and the only reason we do not see it is that we have not yet come to know ourselves.

The second half of the saying is even more pointed. Not knowing yourself is not merely a neutral gap in knowledge. You live in poverty. You are that poverty. The anguish, restlessness, and chronic sense of lack that characterises ordinary human life is not circumstantial — it is a direct consequence of not knowing what you are.

What bridges the two halves? Self-knowledge. "When you know yourselves, you will be known, and you will understand that you are children of the living Father." The journey inward does not lead to isolation — it leads to a recognition of shared being with the ground of all existence.`,

    text: 'Jesus said: An elderly person will not hesitate to ask a seven-day-old infant about the place of life — and that person will live. For many who are first will become last, and they will become a single one.',
    reflection: `This saying overturns every hierarchy of knowledge we take for granted. An elder — bearer of years, experience, social status, accumulated wisdom — goes to a seven-day-old infant with the deepest question a human being can carry: Where is the place of life?

Why an infant? The child has not yet been thoroughly formed by structures of language, social identity, and accumulated self-concept. The child is still, in some sense, closer to the source — not because of superior intelligence, but because less has been layered between original being and the world.

This resonates with a theme found in many traditions: the beginner's mind, the fool's wisdom, the innocence that precedes and perhaps also follows the long middle journey of becoming and forgetting.

The closing phrase — "they will become a single one" — appears throughout the Gospel. It points to a non-dual recognition: the separation we feel, the hierarchy between knower and known, elder and child, self and other, gradually reveals itself as a construction. Underneath it, there is a unity that was never divided.`,

    text: 'Jesus said: Know what is before your face, and what is hidden from you will be revealed to you. For there is nothing hidden that will not become known.',
    reflection: `This saying teaches that clarity of perception is the entire practice. Not some special technique, not a distant revelation, not an earned insight — simply: know what is before your face.

What keeps us from knowing what is before our face? The gap between experience and interpretation. We rarely see what is here; we see our story about what is here. We see our projections, our fears, our wishes, our habitual patterns — all laid over the actual present moment like a transparency. The saying gently insists: see this.

The promise that follows is extraordinary: from radically honestly looking at what is immediate and obvious, the hidden will reveal itself. The hidden is not elsewhere. It is here, embedded in what is present, waiting for the one who looks with full attention.

The final line — there is nothing hidden that will not become known — has both a comforting and uncomfortable resonance. What we seek is not locked away; it will come to light. But also: what we avoid seeing, what we suppress and push out of awareness — this too is continuously moving toward revelation. We can cooperate with this movement or resist it. But we cannot stop it.`,

    text: `Mary said to Jesus, "What do your disciples resemble?" He said, "What they resemble is children living in a plot of land that is not theirs. When the owners of the land come they will say, 'Surrender our land to us.' They, for their part, strip naked in their presence in order to give it back to them, and they give them their land. Thus I say that the owner of an estate, knowing that a bandit is coming, will keep watch before the bandit comes and not let the bandit break into the house of the estate and steal the possessions. You (plur.), then, be on your guard against the world. Arm yourselves with great power lest the brigands find a way to get to you; for the trouble that you expect will come. Let an experienced person dwell in your midst! When the crop had matured, that person came in haste, sickle in hand, and harvested it. Whoever has ears to hear should listen!"`,
    reflection: `This saying is a cornerstone for understanding the Gnostic leanings often attributed to the Gospel of Thomas.

- **The Children** represent the spiritually enlightened — the disciples. They are "little" because they are innocent of worldly attachments.
- **The Field** represents the material world or the physical body; it does not belong to the spirit but is a temporary dwelling.
- **Stripping Naked** is not about literal nudity. In the context of Thomas, "undressing" symbolises shedding the material body or discarding worldly identity to return to a purely spiritual state.
- **The Thief** — a common motif also found in the New Testament — represents the unexpected arrival of a spiritual crisis, used here to emphasise constant mindfulness.

While the "Thief in the Night" imagery appears in Matthew 24:43 and Luke 12:39, the "Children in the Field" parable is unique to the Gospel of Thomas. It shifts the focus from the Second Coming of Christ to the internal realisation of the soul's detachment from the earth.

In the Thomasine tradition, the "world" is a predatory force that seeks to lull the spirit into a sleep of forgetfulness. To "watch" means to recognise that the material world is a distraction. Your "house" is your inner spirit. If you are not home — that is, if you are not mindful — the "thief" (worldly desires, ego, social pressures) can break in and carry away your goods, your divine spark, your clarity.

Ancient houses in the Near East were often made of mud brick. A thief would not just pick a lock; they would dig through the wall. The vigil is meant to catch the intruder before the structural integrity of your inner life is compromised. If you are not paying attention to what you allow in — toxic information, mindless habits, negative environments — you are leaving the door open.`,
    contemplationPrompt: `What areas of your life are you treating as your "home," even though they are temporary or owned by someone else? If the owners showed up today, how much of your identity would be lost with them?

What "garments" — titles, reputations, past grievances — are you wearing so tightly that they feel like your own skin? Could you stand naked, without your achievements or possessions, and still know who you are?

What is currently digging through your walls? Where is the weak point in your perimeter where you tend to lose your focus or your peace? When you are scrolling through your phone or rushing through your day, who is "at home" in your mind?`,

    text: `Jesus saw some infants who were being suckled. He said to his disciples: "These infants being suckled are like those who enter the kingdom." They said to him: "If we then become children, shall we enter the kingdom?" Jesus said to them: "When you make the two one, and when you make the inside as the outside, and the outside as the inside, and the upper as the lower, and when you make the male and the female into a single one, so that the male is not male and the female not female, and when you make eyes in place of an eye, and a hand in place of a hand, and a foot in place of a foot, an image in place of an image — then shall you enter the kingdom."`,
    reflection: `Jesus points to nursing infants as the ultimate insiders of the kingdom. Why? Because an infant does not yet perceive the world through labels, judgements, or divisions. To them, there is no "me" versus "other," no subject versus object. They exist in a state of undifferentiated wholeness.

To enter the kingdom, Jesus describes a radical re-integration of the opposites that usually define our lives:

- **Making the two into one** — moving past the "this vs. that" mentality.
- **Inside and outside** — ensuring your internal reality (thoughts, spirit) matches your external reality (actions, body).
- **Upper and lower** — bridging the divine and the mundane.
- **Male and female** — transcending gendered ego roles to reach a state of oneness where you are not defined by biological or social binaries.

You enter the kingdom when you stop slicing the world into pieces and start seeing the underlying unity in everything.

We begin in a state of oneness because we do not know any better. There is no "me" and "not-me" — just existence. It is beautiful, but it is unconscious. Then we enter duality: good vs. evil, male vs. female, success vs. failure. We get lost here because we mistake the divisions for the final truth. The third stage — conscious oneness — is the Kingdom. By finding the divine spark within, we collapse the dualities. We realise the outside and the inside were never actually separate.

The journey is not about becoming something new. It is about remembering what you were before the world told you that you were separate from it.`,

    text: `Jesus said: "I shall choose you, one out of a thousand and two out of ten thousand, and they shall stand as a single one."`,
    reflection: `Choosing someone does not mean they are more worthy; it means they are ready. The ego loves to interpret "chosen" as "special" or "superior." But in the context of deep inner work, being chosen is more like a crop being ready for harvest. A green tomato is not less worthy than a red one — it simply needs more time on the vine. To force the process before the individual is ready is harmful.

In depth psychology — Carl Jung's work on individuation, for instance — facing the unconscious mind, dismantling ego-stories, and looking at our shadows requires a strong, stable internal container. When we are not ready, forcing this work can lead to fragmentation, severe anxiety, or a breakdown. The ego braces against it because it feels threatened.

Some spiritual traditions call this the Bodhisattva path: those who do the arduous inner work do not do it to escape the world, but to return to it and assist others. By facing your own darkness and finding wholeness, you change the energetic blueprint available to those around you. You model a new way of being. You prove that freedom is possible, which quietly gives others permission to seek it when their time comes.

When we are ready, we can observe our inner workings without falling apart. We outgrow our limiting narratives and integrate the difficult parts of ourselves — fulfilling the end of this saying: we stand as a single one. Whole, unified, and integrated.

You are ready when you can choose yourself.`,
    contemplationPrompt: `Where am I still waiting for external permission to choose myself? What specific, outgrown story about my identity am I holding onto just because it makes other people comfortable? When I feel "unready," am I actually just bracing against the process rather than trusting my own wholeness?`,

    reflection: `The disciples are looking for a geographical or external spiritual "place" where Jesus resides so they can travel there to find it. Jesus dismisses the idea of a destination out in the world and points them inward instead.

The "person of light" refers to an individual who has awakened to the divine spark within themselves. In the Thomasine tradition, enlightenment is not found by following a leader to a specific location. It is found by recognising the primordial truth that already exists inside you. When this inner light is realised and lived, it naturally radiates outward, giving clarity and light to the rest of the world. Conversely, failing to recognise and live from this inner light leaves the individual — and those around them — in darkness and confusion.

The disciples' question is the same one we ask whenever we look outward for answers that can only be found within: Which teacher should I follow? Which tradition holds the truth? Which method will finally fix me? Jesus turns the question around. The place you are seeking is not somewhere you can travel to. It is what you are looking out from right now.`,

Am I mistaking the map for the territory — spending so much time studying the paths others have walked that I am neglecting to walk my own?`,

    text: 'Jesus said: Love your brother as your soul; watch over him like the apple of your eye.',
    reflection: `### I. The Nature of the Soul: The Divine Spark

This text immediately reminds of love your neighbour as yourself. But it goes deeper. It is not just "as yourself" — it is "as your soul." The soul is not the ego, the personality, or the social self. It is the divine essence within you that is identical to the divine essence within others.
When we are told to love our brother "as our soul," we are being asked to love him not for what he does or doesn't do, but for the divine essence within him (for who he really is - not what we are seeing on the surface).  
It is a literal instruction to recognise that the person in front of you is not just a separate individual, but a manifestation of the same divine essence that animates you.

Many times we love based on "ego-level" connections—DNA, shared politics, or tribal loyalty. This love is conditional. To love a brother "as your soul" is to look past his personality, flaws, or opinions and recognize the Living Father (the source of all consciousness) animating him. You are loving the essential light within him that is identical to the light within you.

### The "Apple of Your Eye" Metaphor

The phrase "apple of your eye" is more than an ancient idiom; it is a lesson in biological and spiritual vulnerability.

In antiquity, the pupil was called the "apple" of the eye. It is the literal opening through which light enters the body. While it is the most vital part of our sensory experience, it is also the most fragile.

Consider the blink reflex. If an object moves toward your eye, you don't pause to deliberate. You don't weigh the pros and cons of protection. Your body acts instinctively and instantly.
Protecting your brother should be as reflexive as blinking. His wellbeing and safety is not a "choice" you make; it is a biological necessity for your shared spiritual body.

When you watch over another like the apple of your eye, the rigid boundary between "me" and "you" begins to dissolve. By directing your "eyes" toward another's well-being, you acknowledge that their spiritual safety is tethered to your own.

### The Reality of Unity

In a state of unity, the Golden Rule moves from a moral command to a logical fact. You cannot mistreat your brother without simultaneously wounding yourself.

To fail in loving your brother is to cloud your own spiritual vision. If you cannot see the light in him, it probably means you only see darkness in others because you have not yet fully recognised the light within you.

This text becomes more than a command or rule. You don't care for others simply to "stay safe." You do it because you realize that by living this way, you are manifesting a world suited for the Divine Spark, rather than a world built for the competing demands of the ego.`,
    contemplationPrompt: `When I look within or without, do I immediately fixate on my/another's shortcomings, my/another's anxieties, or my/another's unhealed parts? Can I use my inner light to illuminate these shadow aspects without identifying with them? 

When I am interacting with someone—especially someone difficult—where is my focal point? Can I intentionally adjust my depth of field? Practice looking past the immediate static of their ego. Remind yourself that you are looking at an "other-self"—the exact same Source experiencing the universe from a different set of coordinates and through a different complex system of conditioning.

Can I separate the signal from the noise? When someone acts out of ego, can I see it not as who they are, but as a distortion in their lens? Watching over them "like the apple of your eye" means holding the vision of their true nature for them, especially during the moments when they have forgotten it themselves.

Is my recognition of the soul in others becoming a reflex, or does it still require immense mental effort? When I walk past a stranger, is my first instinctual read based on their avatar (their clothes, status, demeanor), or is there a split-second, reflexive honoring of the life force within them?`,

      {
        term: 'The Eye as a Mirror',
        definition: `When you start to view the eye as a reflective surface rather than just a receptor, the instruction to "watch over him like the apple of your eye" takes on a completely new dimension. You are no longer just guarding the other person; you are guarding the very mechanism through which you understand yourself.

### 1. The Literal Mirror: The Physics of the Cornea

The cornea — the clear, protective outer layer of the eye — is highly reflective. It functions as a convex mirror. If you stand close enough to look directly into someone else's pupil, the physics of light dictate that you will see a miniature reflection of your own face superimposed over their iris and pupil. You literally cannot look deeply into the "soul" of another person without seeing yourself reflected back in the process.

### 2. The Psychological Mirror: Projection and the Shadow

We rarely see people exactly as they are. Instead, we see them through the lens of our own preconceived ideas, stories, and conditioning. If we carry unresolved anger, we are hyper-vigilant to hostility in others. The people who trigger the strongest emotional reactions in us — whether intense infatuation or deep irritation — are usually holding up a mirror to our own unconscious archetypes. Recognising this transforms every frustrating interaction into a profound opportunity for self-awareness.

### 3. The Metaphysical Mirror: The "Other-Self"

If we view reality through the lens of unified consciousness, the separation between "you" and "me" is just a structural illusion necessary for experiencing the universe. The individual soul is not disconnected from the Source; it is a fractal reflection of it. Therefore, every "other" is quite literally an "other-self" — the exact same consciousness peering out from a different set of biological coordinates. When you look into the eye of your brother and recognise the divine spark, the Creator is using your eyes to look at Itself through the eyes of the other. This is the ultimate fulfilment of Saying 22's instruction to make "the inside like the outside."

If the eye is a mirror, then judgement is a form of self-harm, and deep appreciation is a form of self-love. What you refuse to love in the "other-self" is a part of yourself you have exiled into darkness.`

    text: 'Jesus said: You see the mote which is in your brother\'s eye; but you do not see the beam which is in your own eye. When you cast out the beam from your own eye, then you will see (clearly) to cast out the mote from your brother\'s eye.',
    reflection: `This is a text many of us already know from the Bible (Matthew 7:3-5; Luke 6:41-42). Sometimes passages like these are frequently used as a moralistic weapon — a warning against hypocrisy. Unfortunately, many times we stop here. However, this text is a deep psychological and spiritual tool for self-awareness. It brings us closer to the truth of human nature.

**The "Mote" as a Mirror**

The "mote" acts as a mirror. This is referred to as projection or interacting with our "shadow." We unconsciously take the traits, insecurities, or flaws that we cannot accept within ourselves and project them onto the people around us.

When a minor flaw in someone else triggers a disproportionately large emotional reaction in us — anger, extreme annoyance, or disgust — it is almost always a sign that we are reacting to our own reflection. It causes us to attack the projection rather than seeing the person's soul.

Jesus uses the deliberate image of a massive, load-bearing beam to show the absurdity of trying to fix or point out something that bothers us in another, while we cannot see at all. Our ego protects us from seeing our own massive unhealed wounds, allowing us to hyper-fixate on the microscopic dust in others instead. It is easier for us to try to fix someone else's problem than to sit with our own. However, while we are blind it is not wise to do so.

**The Necessity of Self-Compassion**

One cannot go within blindly and expect to see anything else but darkness. It will be too hard to look at the hurt and the pain within when you only see yourself as the "small self / false self." Identifying with the truth of yourself — really being the divine spark — is how you can enter with love, care, and acceptance. Finding the courage to look inward with a forgiving and compassionate eye immediately softens the lens through which you see everyone else.

This is the crux of true healing. Many people realise they need to look at their own flaws, but they do so with a harsh, judgmental, and punishing inner critic. Fighting inner darkness with more darkness — shame, guilt, self-hatred — only deepens the wound. Real transformation requires radical self-compassion. We have to look at our own "beams" with the same grace and unconditional love that we are ultimately trying to extend to our brother with the "mote."`,
    contemplationPrompt: `**Think of a recent moment when someone's behaviour triggered a strong reaction in you — anger, intense annoyance, or judgment**.


- What was the specific trait or action that bothered me so deeply?
- If I strip away the details of the story, what is the core emotion I felt (e.g., disrespected, unseen, out of control, inadequate)?
- Why does this specific trait or action feel so threatening or offensive to me?
- Can I feel the emotion without identifying with it?



**Now, take the trait that frustrated you in the other person and gently look for it within yourself.**


- Where does this exact trait exist in my own life, even if it shows up in a different context or in a hidden way?
- Is this a part of myself that I deeply dislike, deny, or try to hide from others?
- Am I currently treating myself the way I perceive this person is treating me?



**This is the crucial step of refusing to fight darkness with darkness.**


- When I recognise this "beam" within myself, what is my immediate internal reaction? Do I attack myself, or do I offer myself grace?
- What is the original wound or fear that caused me to develop this flaw or defence mechanism in the first place?
- If I were looking at a dear friend who had this exact same flaw and wound, what compassionate words would I say to them? Can I say them to myself?



**Bring the person who originally triggered you back into your mind's eye.**


- Now that I see they were unknowingly mirroring my own unhealed pain, how does my perspective of them shift?
- Can I see their frustrating behaviour not as an attack on me, but as a symptom of their own struggle or lack of awareness?
- What would it look like to interact with them next time from a place of shared humanity, rather than from a place of defence and projection?`,

    text: 'Jesus said, If you do not fast as regards the world, you will not find the kingdom. If you do not observe the Sabbath as a Sabbath, you will not see the father.',
    reflection: `### Fasting

Fasting is not about performance or the literal aspects of fasting (such as physical starvation). "Fasting as regards" the world is a necessary detachment from external noise, anxiety and the pursuit of validation.

### The Internal Kingdom

The kingdom cannot be found in the world but is found within. It is important to find the space where you can close the door behind you and go within.

Sometimes we believe that if we work hard enough, we will earn enough and then we will be able to rest. The invitation is to live now. To meet the kingdom now.

If you seek peace outside of yourself, you won't find it.

True authority must come from within rather than being surrendered to external forces. For example, waiting for the politicians to change the constitution before you can feel at peace or waiting for a person to call you before you don't feel alone.

### Sabbath

Jesus talks about observing the Sabbath. Keeping the Sabbath is not a rigid law, but is about having a mandatory pause from striving, producing and surviving. It is a space designed for receiving rather than acting.

The Gnostics didn't keep laws for law's sake. The Sabbath was a day of rest. This was the day that one didn't create (not create wealth or other things) but rested like the Creator did. If the Creator needed rest, why wouldn't we. This rest is necessary to see the father. We can't see what is really important to us, while we are striving and performing. 

### Balance

The goal isn't to become a permanent ascetic or to remain silent forever. In fact, it is not a goal to achieve. It is about recognising your wholeness and being present. One cannot strive or become it. You are already it. You just need to be reminded of it. These practices help us to engage with the world and create from a place of inner abundance, rather than from a frantic state of survival.

In our hyper-connected, productivity-obsessed culture, the idea of "running away from silence" is a very real epidemic. Jesus' words are an invitation to take a step back, to "fast from the world". It is not a punishment but a necessary recalibration to make us feel "safe or at home" in our own minds.`,

In what ways am I performing my strength or goodness for others, rather than quietly cultivating it for myself?

    text: 'Jesus said: I stood in the midst of the world, and I appeared to them in the flesh. I found them all drunk; I found none of them thirsting, and my soul was afflicted for the sons of men; for they are blind in their heart, and they do not see that they came empty into the world, (and) empty they seek to leave the world again. But now they are drunk. When they have thrown off their wine, they will repent.',
    reflection: `### The Incarnate Teacher and the Burden of Flesh

Jesus speaks here from the perspective of an awakened consciousness that has actively entered the human experience ("appeared to them in the flesh"). By taking on a physical form, he became subject to the same biological, root-level realities—hunger, thirst, fatigue—as the rest of humanity. Yet, his affliction is not physical; it is a profound grief over the collective unconsciousness of those around him.

### Drunkenness vs. The Necessity of Thirst

To be "drunk" in this context is to be completely intoxicated by the material world and the ego's endless loop of desires. Jesus laments finding no one "thirsting." Spiritual thirst is the vital prerequisite for seeking; it is the deep, unsettling realization that mundane life is not enough. A thirsty soul seeks the "living water" of truth and connection to the divine source. When humanity loses this thirst and settles for the numbing effects of worldly indulgence, the collective state of the world descends into suffering and illusion.

### Blindness of the Heart and the "Sons of Men"

By calling them the "sons of men," Jesus highlights how deeply people have identified with their mortal, physical lineage, entirely forgetting their divine origins. To be "blind in their heart" points to a severe spiritual disconnection. They are operating purely from their base survival instincts and egoic drives (the root), completely bypassing the heart—the center of true spiritual vision, empathy, and recognition of the interconnected whole.

### The Unconscious Cycle of Emptiness

Coming into the world "empty" and leaving "empty" describes a state of total spiritual amnesia. It speaks to the tragedy of moving through an entire incarnation—arriving without the memory of one's divine spark, and leaving the physical realm having gained no self-knowledge, despite having spent a lifetime accumulating fleeting, material illusions.

### Sobering Up: The True Meaning of Repentance

"Throwing off their wine" represents a deliberate detoxification from societal conditioning and material obsession. It is the reclamation of spiritual sovereignty. Crucially, "they will repent" is not a demand for moral groveling or guilt over sins. In the esoteric sense, this reflects metanoia—a fundamental, radical transformation of mind and heart. It is the exact moment the soul shakes off its amnesia, steps out of the dream-state, and makes the active, conscious choice to wake up to its true nature.`,

Forgetfulness (Amnesia): The soul "forgets" its heavenly home and its true identity as a spark of the divine. It becomes preoccupied with the needs and desires of the body.

Unconsciousness: This refers to living on "autopilot." People are physically awake but spiritually asleep, unaware of the deeper reality or the presence of the Light within them.

    reflection: `This saying reminds us of our hidden potential, or the divine spark within. We are capable of being and doing great things. However, we often choose to remain in a cage rather than embracing the opportunity we have here and now.

The saying frames the tension between our eternal nature and our temporary human experience. People frequently argue about the nature of existence: are we spiritual beings having a human experience, or is the spirit simply born from the physical (the materialist view)? Jesus doesn't express disgust at the physical body; he expresses amazement. He says, "it is a wonder of wonders." He is marvelling at the sheer paradox of incarnation—how the infinite, limitless spirit managed to squeeze itself into a finite, fragile, physical form.

Jesus plays with the question of which came first—the body or the spirit. By calling it a "wonder of wonders" if the spirit came from the body (the materialist view), he is gently pointing out the absurdity of thinking that the profound depth of human consciousness could merely be a byproduct of physical matter.

The word "but" acts as a wake-up call. Jesus points to a truth that goes much deeper than a religious or philosophical debate. By pointing out the stark contrast between our internal "wealth" and external "poverty," the saying invites us to stop living as beggars chasing worldly scraps when we hold the treasury of the universe within us.`,

    text: 'Jesus said: Where there are three gods, they are gods; where there are two or one, I am with him.',
    reflection: `Saying 30 offers a striking counterpoint to the canonical promise of Matthew 18:20: "For where two or three gather in my name, there am I with them" (NIV). While the traditional gospel champions the institutional ideal of community fellowship, the Gnostic text suggests something far more intimate: that the divine presence is profoundly accessible to the solitary individual or a unified pair. This anti-institutional stance is not merely a theological shift; it acknowledges the inherent difficulty of maintaining true, unguarded spiritual connection within larger gatherings.

### The Weight of the Collective

Groups operate differently from individuals. When a larger group forms (like three people), a collective consciousness takes over. The need to "fit the mold" activates our deeply ingrained survival mechanisms, causing the persona (the mask we wear for society) to eclipse our authentic inner voice. In this environment, vulnerability becomes a risk. We tend to leave our bodies (become disembodied) and shift our focus entirely to the external. The solitary state, or the safety of one-on-one connection, strips away the static of group convention, allowing the true Self to emerge.

### The Fractal Self

The individual is also a community and that pattern repeats in nature. It is a fractal view of existence, where the microcosm perfectly mirrors the macrocosm. Just as a complex system is made of interconnected layers and feedback loops that reflect the behaviour of the whole, the individual psyche is a multiplicity of experiences, unconscious drives, and archetypes unified into a single being. You do not need an external crowd to be part of a gathering; you are already a rich, complex community within yourself.

### Omnipresence

Another saying (77) ends with: "Split a piece of wood, and I am there. Lift up the stone, and you will find me there" — allowing for more context to the above text.

If the divine permeates absolutely everything — from the quiet solitude of a single mind to the physical matter of the earth itself — then the rigid boundaries between being "in the church" and walking one's own path completely dissolve. It neutralizes the need to judge how others seek connection, recognizing that no one can ever truly be separated from the whole.`,

Yet Elijah was not sent to any of them, but to the widow of Zarephath in Sidon. And there were many lepers in Israel in the time of Elisha the prophet.

It brings two very relatable, human questions to the surface: *Who do you think you are?* and *Why would a person, like me, be able to do something that is perceived to be miraculous?* We often experience a deep sense of doubt about our own inner knowing. This doubt stems directly from the misconception that we are mere physical beings, which leads to a fundamental misunderstanding of who we truly are.

### The Trap of Familiarity and Separation

When you grow up in a small town, people "know" the human version of you. They see you as a child, a friend, or simply a person who makes mistakes. Because of this familiarity, they can easily become blind to the reality that Source is found within you — just as it is found within them.

This highlights our human tendency to separate the mundane from the miraculous:

- **The Illusion of Separation:** We habitually separate our oneness with God/Source from our everyday human life.
- **Limiting the Divine:** We operate under the assumption that a "mere human" shouldn't be able to perform miracles or do the work that is supposedly reserved only for God.

While this separation gives us the unique, tangible experience of being a person in a physical body, it also deeply hurts us. It closes us off to healing because we refuse to remain open to it. We fail to believe that an ordinary person can assist us, and worse, we fail to believe that we possess the power to heal ourselves.

### The Conditions We Place on Grace

In this space of separation and closed-mindedness, we miss out on the grace that is available to us daily — simply because we don't want to receive it in the form it takes.

We place strict conditions on miracles:

- **The "Right" Package:** We expect divine help to look a certain way and to come exclusively from the outside.
- **The Demand for a Spectacle:** We act as if God is far away, believing that if a miracle isn't spectacular and witnessed by everyone, it isn't real.
- **Missing the Quiet Miracles:** We struggle to accept that profound healing can happen in the quiet, mundane spaces of our own homes, or through the hands of people we already know.

Ultimately, we have been conditioned to limit our possibilities. And by insisting on those limitations, we are forced to constantly experience them.`,
    contemplationPrompt: `**1. Examining Internal Blocks**
What thoughts or beliefs do I hold that close me off to assistance or healing in a specific form? Reflect on times you may have rejected help or growth because it didn't come in the "package" you expected. How does the illusion of separation keep you from receiving grace?

**2. Shifting Perspective**
Can I find miracles in the mundane and within myself? Consider the quiet, everyday moments where Source is present. How can you better recognize the divine in your ordinary human experience without needing a grand spectacle?

**3. Projecting Limitations**
Do I make others feel like nothing good can come from them because I expect the miraculous to only come from something "out of the ordinary"? Examine how you view the people closest to you. Are you guilty of the "hometown crowd" mentality — limiting the potential of your friends, family, or community because you are too familiar with their human flaws?`,

    text: 'Jesus said, "Whatever you (sing.) hear with your ear, proclaim upon your (plur.) rooftops into the other ear. Indeed, no one lights a lamp and puts it under a vessel, nor puts it in a hidden place. Rather it is put on a lampstand so that each who enters and leaves might see its light."',
    reflection: `### I. The Mystery of the Two Ears

In this passage, Jesus describes a cycle of resonance.

- **The First Ear (The Download):** This is the inner, receptive ear. It's that high-pitched "ringing" in the ear or the sudden "download" of insight. It is the moment truth enters the soul.
- **The Waiting Period:** We wait for this "ringing" to become conscious so we can actually live it.
- **The Second Ear (The Reflection):** Interestingly, the text suggests the "other ear" needs to hear it again. When we proclaim the truth on the "rooftops" of our lives, we hear it back. The inner listening and the outer experience become symmetrical. We broadcast the truth, and in doing so, we confirm it within ourselves.

We carry a divine spark within us, but we often mistake the "vessel" for the light itself.

- **The Identity Crisis:** If we take on the identity of the vessel (our ego, our social form, our physical appearance), we are essentially trying to hide our true self.
- **Form vs. Truth:** Sometimes the "form" of a message — the rituals, the rules, or the rigid structures — actually takes away from the truth of the message.
- **The Lampstand:** The lampstand represents the interaction. When the spark is placed on the lampstand, it is no longer hidden. Everyone who "enters and leaves" can see it. The truth is meant to be functional, not just internal.

### III. The Shadow of Secrecy (The Hidden Places)

Historically, many societies kept wisdom only to themselves. Groups like the ancient Mystery Schools or even certain religious hierarchies believed the light was "too bright" for the common person, so they put the lamp in "hidden places."

Jesus' instruction is a radical departure from this gatekeeping. He argues that truth isn't a secret to be hoarded by an elite few; it is a reality to be shared with anyone walking through the door.

### IV. Integration: The Whole Brain & The Whole Life

To truly move the light from the vessel to the lampstand, we must listen with both sides (the left and right hemispheres of the brain).

When we integrate our logic and our intuition, the light burns in such a way that we physically cannot keep it within our vessel.

Repeating for importance: just as a message repeated is a sign of its importance, the repetition of our inner truth through our outer actions creates a life of integrity.

### V. The Embodied Light (The Dish-Washing Moment)

The ultimate goal of this "rooftop proclamation" is not a sermon; it is embodiment. When the light is on the lampstand, it shows up in the most mundane, real-life moments:

- It shows in our dancing.
- It shows in our lips and how we speak to others.
- It shows in the way we wash the dishes.`,

    text: 'Jesus said: If a blind man leads a blind man, they both fall into a pit.',
    reflection: `### From Proverb to Paradox

The saying, "If a blind man leads a blind man, they both fall into a pit," functions as both a warning and a psychological mirror. While often interpreted as a call for religious leaders to have a "correct" understanding of scripture, the teaching goes far deeper than professional competency. It speaks to the source of the light we use to navigate our lives.

### The Internal Blind Leader

We often act as our own blind guides. When we try to "fix" a personal struggle using the "darkness" of shame, guilt, or self-judgment, we are essentially a blind person trying to lead a blind person. You cannot use the energy of the problem (judgment) to find the energy of the solution (growth). To look at your own "darkness" with more darkness only ensures that you remain in the pit. Growth requires a shift in frequency — moving from the blindness of "fixing" to the sight of "understanding."

### The Specialist's Blindness

In our society, we often defer to "experts" or "specialists." However, a specialist who only treats symptoms is oblivious to the holistic flow of life. If a guide — whether a doctor, a CEO, or a spiritual teacher — is blind to the deeper laws of how the world works, they may lead us toward a temporary fix that results in a greater fall later. This is why the inner listening is so vital; it acts as a secondary verification for the "expert" advice we receive.

### The Symmetry of Sight

This saying also points to the Reflective Symmetry of our lives. The leaders we follow and the "pit" we fall into are often reflections of our own internal state of consciousness. If we carry "divine light" within, we become sensitive to when a path is leading nowhere. Like the parable of the harvest, where the master sees the readiness of the wheat while the workers see only the surface, true sight allows us to perceive the timing and fruitfulness of a situation.

### Conclusion

Remaining true to our "inner knowing" is not an act of rebellion, but an act of sight. It is the refusal to follow a promise that doesn't align with the truth we see in the light of our own expanded consciousness.`,

To change the direction of the "fall," one must first illuminate the inner landscape so that the outer path becomes clear.'

> "Consider how the wild flowers grow. They do not labor or spin. Yet I tell you, not even Solomon in all his splendor was dressed like one of these."

At first glance this text is about not worrying about basic needs — to trust that you will be taken care of (which is true). But unfortunately it may also lead us to think that we should wait on something or someone outside of us to provide for us. We don't see ourselves as part of, or a participant in, the process — and we don't understand that we create what we don't want to create when we worry about these things day and night. Furthermore, it may also point to how we worry about being perceived by others. This scarcity/fear mindset steals from our inner peace and knowing.

This verse may therefore remind us to embody abundance and not lack. When our minds are busy with worries all the time, there is not much space to see the potential, opportunities and love that surrounds us. Our perspective and thought patterns shape our world view. This is why creating space in the mind — being quiet — is so helpful, as it brings us back to center, where all lives and is possible, making us hear our inner guidance and living from oneness.`,

    text: 'His disciples said: On what day will you be revealed to us, and on what day shall we see you? Jesus said: When you unclothe yourselves and are not ashamed and take your garments and lay them beneath your feet like the little children (and) trample on them, then [you will see] the Son of the Living One, and you will not be afraid.',
    reflection: `At first glance, we are reminded of Jesus' resurrection and what the disciples believed would be his return. They asked: "On what day will you be revealed to us?" Just like the disciples, our minds and egos seek assurance. We want to know the date and time, as we struggle with uncertainty. There are two questions here: one is about revelation, and the other is about seeing Jesus again. In a sense, the disciples realise that they can't see Jesus as he is yet, and they want to know when they will know who he is or see the real being. The second question relates to seeing him physically again. Many Christians also await the second coming of Christ, where Jesus will return in the flesh.

Jesus' answer is that when we have shed our egos and stories — when we no longer identify with them — and when we are no longer ashamed about who we are as we have learned who we truly are, if we are willing to lay our "garments (armour)" down and trample on them like children (being free of the guilt, shame, and old identities that don't fit), not yet being so enmeshed with our worldly role and story — we will see Christ. We will see the Son of the Living One, meaning that we will recognize ourselves as sons of the Living One, and we will no longer be afraid as we will recognize our oneness and the Christ within. Christ's return happens within us when we, as the sons of the living Father, arise to the truth.

    text: 'Jesus said: Many times have you desired to hear these words which I speak to you, and you have no other from whom to hear them. Days will come when you will seek me (and) you will not find me.',
    reflection: `Similar texts:
- **Luke 17:22:** Jesus tells his disciples, "The time is coming when you will long to see one of the days of the Son of Man, but you won't see it."
- **John 7:34:** Jesus tells the religious leaders, "You will look for me, but you will not find me; and where I am, you cannot come."

This text may point to the reality of life where we experience moments of clarity due to having a teacher or higher consciousness that guides and calms us. But when the teacher is no longer there to guide or calm, it won't help to seek him, as you won't find him in this way. This shows just how important it is for the student to cultivate the light within. There will come challenges on your path where no teacher is available, and where you have to walk the road "seemingly" alone. As you progress in your development, there also comes a time when other people may not be able to help you, as they may not have grown to a place where they can assist. You will then have to figure things out on your own or in a different way. When a student relies solely on an external source for light, the absence of a guide leaves them in utter darkness.

We can, therefore, move from a place of seeking outer guidance to finding the guidance within — guidance that has been internalized. The text further serves as a reminder to be present. The disciples have a rare opportunity to hear words that they would normally not hear. If they are truly present to hear and integrate the words spoken, it may assist them when they no longer have a teacher with them. "Days will come" indicates that this is not forever, but the student will experience a time when they feel alone and there is no clarity for moving forward.

Even in our modern age, there are times when we may wish for guidance from Jesus about what he meant or the path ahead. This is a process of seeking and finding. However, there comes a time when seeking doesn't bring answers anymore, and one may then find the strength to go within and discover what was there all along.`,

    text: 'Jesus said: The Pharisees and the scribes have taken the keys of knowledge (gnosis) (and) have hidden them. They did not go in, and those who wished to go in they did not allow. But you, be wise as serpents and innocent as doves.',
    reflection: `Another translation: ['Jesus says, "The Pharisees and the scribes have] re[ceived the keys] of [knowledge and have] hid[den them; neither have they] enter[ed nor permitted those who would] enter. [But you] bec[ome wi]se a[s the serpents and g]uileless [as the dov]es' (see also Hennecke and Schneemelcher: 1.112-113)." (In Fragments, p. 33)

Similar texts:
- **Luke 11:52:** Woe to you experts in the law, because you have taken away the key to knowledge. You yourselves have not entered, and you have hindered those who were entering.
- **Matthew 10:16:** I am sending you out like sheep among wolves. Therefore be as shrewd [discerning] as snakes and as innocent as doves.

Historically, we have seen how knowledge that could help people gain understanding and improve their lives has been burned, hidden, or kept by a select few who believed only they could interpret the texts. Jesus points out how the lawmakers (the authorities) received the knowledge to improve their own lives and the lives of others, yet chose not to enter the kingdom. Some chose to control others by keeping the knowledge to themselves.

They have not "permitted those who would enter" to do so, meaning that people who were seeking knowledge and open to it were actively kept from it by the authorities. People, who wanted the knowledge to be freely available for everyone (whether they were scientists or religious leaders), have been attacked or killed. They were seen as a threat to the authorities' perceived control.

Jesus reminds us to be as wise, shrewd, and discerning as snakes. Snakes are careful creatures; they hide when people are near and do not reveal themselves, ensuring they are not killed when a person strikes at them out of fear. There are, in fact, many snakes in our surrounding, but we don't know that they are there. This allows them to work under the radar.

Jesus also says to be as innocent as doves. This highlights the complex nature of the world. One must be vigilant because there are real dangers — forces and people who seek to withhold growth and light from others. However, we must still maintain our innocence to be able to hear the kingdom within. When we fight those who seek to destroy us, we risk becoming entangled in worldly affairs and we fight darkness with more darkness. Ultimately, this is about being smart and strategic so that we can remain innocent while living in this world. If we feel, for example, that a situation or action is not good for our soul, we should listen to that inner guidance.`,

    text: 'Jesus said: He who has in his hand, to him shall be given; and he who has not, from him shall be taken even the little that he has.',
    reflection: `This statement may seem unfair to some, as many people believe that those who do not have will inherit everything and those who do have will lose what they have — which speaks to a jealous nature, one that seeks others to suffer as they suffer. They don't yet see a world where all can thrive. Some want to believe that if they struggle and possess fewer things now, they will receive a nice, big reward when they get to heaven. This is a scarcity perspective. It views resources and grace as finite, allowing a competitive nature to possess us.

If we solely view the material world as a place of "haves" and "have-nots," we actively create that reality. I have often found that people who have many things to be grateful for frequently focus only on what they lack, and in doing so, create even more lack in their lives. This idea challenges us to understand that when we have something to give (when there is something "in our hand"), that is more than material possessions. We are the divine spark. We are thus not losing something by giving it away.

Conversely, when we say that we have nothing to give, we are denying the gift of our divine spark. By looking only at our possessions and believing that they define us, we inevitably create more lack. We lose what we have because we do not live from our inner light. Things will change. Furniture may break. Material items may get lost or stolen, but it can't touch our light.

Some equate this teaching with working hard in the material world to gain more, not realising that it is not about hard work either. In fact, many people work tirelessly due to a scarcity mindset — constantly feeling behind the curve or believing they never have enough yet.

Interestingly, the material and mental worlds are deeply connected. As another commentator noted: to enter the Kingdom means to see the real world behind mental concepts. Such a person truly "possesses," and will therefore be given more — all the joy of life one can accept, which is Life itself. Those who continue to view the world through their mental concepts do not "possess." They live in their minds and are thus condemned to lose what they have, since what they have is subject to the law of change and perishes in the end.

Ultimately, our inner attitude and perspective shape our world. We can try to make great choices, do everything right, and work incredibly hard, yet still feel like victims if we haven't dug up the treasure within and started living from Source.`,

    text: 'Jesus said: Become passers-by!',
    reflection: `Other related texts:
- **Romans 12:2:** Do not conform to the pattern of this world, but be transformed by the renewing of your mind. Then you will be able to test and approve what God's will is — his good, pleasing and perfect will.
- **John 17:14:** I have given them your word and the world has hated them, for they are not of the world any more than I am of the world.

**Scholarly Quote:**

Marvin Meyer writes: "This saying may also be translated 'Be wanderers'; compare descriptions in early Christian literature of wandering teachers and missionaries. Another possible but less likely translation is, 'Come into being as you pass away'; compare the use of the same word parage as 'pass away' in the first riddle in saying 11, and other statements similar to this translation of saying 42 (for example, 2 Corinthians 4:16; Acts of John 76: 'Die so that you may live'). Tjitze Baarda, 'Jesus Said: Be Passers-By,' suggests yet another possible translation, 'Be Hebrews,' with the understanding of Philo of Alexandria that the word 'Hebrews' may be taken as 'migrants.' A medieval author, Petrus Alphonsi, preserves a saying much like saying 42 in his Clerical Instruction: 'This world is, as it were, a bridge. Therefore, pass over it, only do not lodge there.'"

Jesus is guiding his followers to be in the world without being of the world. Though brief, the text is rich with meaning. Becoming a "passer-by" requires a level of detachment, but this does not mean we cannot enjoy life or engage with society. Instead, it means remaining true to our inner light, even when pressured to conform to mainstream thought. We are meant to experience this world, learn from it, and then move forward. Often, we remain stuck — refusing to grow after learning new truths — because we fear becoming too different and losing our sense of belonging. Yet, if our true identity was not created here, it makes perfect sense to feel like a foreigner. You may feel as though you do not fit in; you are not meant to.

This philosophy does not require nihilism or living in isolation; it simply requires staying true to the light within. The world, our personalities, our jobs, the weather, and other people will inevitably change, but our inner light is a constant. It provides the stability we need to avoid fear and hatred when we feel threatened by change. Society constantly tempts us to adopt false identities to fit a specific mold, and speaking the truth often leads to judgment or rejection. Our primal fear of rejection frequently prevents us from embracing our truth and following our inner guidance. However, when we live from Source, we learn to trust our inner world more than our external circumstances — and in doing so, we change the world around us. Not by forcing others to see what we see, but by living it. Conversely, when we allow ourselves to be ruled by the external world, our inner world fractures, trapping us in a cycle of chaos.

The meaning of this text also shifts depending on the listener. For a disciple who has not yet realized their true nature and views Jesus primarily as an external Savior, becoming a "passer-by" might mean adhering to strict rules or dietary laws that others ignore. However, for those who understand they are not of this world, this text serves as a profound reminder of how to navigate earthly life.`,

    text: `His disciples said to him: Who are you, that you say these things to us? <Jesus said to them:> From what I say to you, do you not know who I am? But you have become like the Jews; for they love the tree (and) hate its fruit, and they love the fruit (and) hate the tree.`,
    reflection: `There is a tension between who Jesus is and what people expected him to be. This is still true today. We often cannot see in others what we refuse to recognize within ourselves. Because the disciples did not recognize their own inner light, they couldn't reconcile Jesus' humanity with his divinity. They were expecting a conventional, worldly king – and therefore missed the reality of seeing the divine in the ordinary. This speaks to a common human blind spot: we struggle to accept extraordinary truths when they come in ordinary packages.

Jesus compares his disciples to the Jews (you can replace Jews with any school of thought). The Jews hoarded knowledge. They loved being the teacher or the knowledgeable one. However, actually carrying the fruit – living the wisdom daily – requires stripping away the ego, engaging in deep self-reflection and fundamentally changing how one lives. It takes time, patience and requires change.

We often split the tree and the fruit into palatable and unpalatable parts.

- **Loving the fruit, hating the tree:** We might love the art, the philosophy, or the benefits someone provides, but we despise the flawed, plain, or complex human being who produced it.
- **Loving the tree, hating the fruit:** We might love a person for their familiarity or plainness, but resent them when they grow, speak hard truths, or challenge our world view ("Who do you think you are?").

By separating the tree and the fruit, we are avoiding the challenging reality of oneness. True wisdom is not just the words spoken or the person speaking them – it is the living integration of the two.`,

    text: 'Jesus said: He who blasphemes against the Father will be forgiven, and he who blasphemes against the Son will be forgiven; but he who blasphemes against the Holy Spirit will not be forgiven, either on earth or in heaven.',
    reflection: `### Understanding Some Context

**The Meaning of Forgiveness**

In orthodox dogma, "forgiveness" is often viewed as a legal pardon from a judge. But in esoteric, Gnostic, and psychological traditions, forgiveness is closer to its original Greek root in the New Testament, aphesis, which means "release," "letting go," or "return to wholeness." It is returning to wholeness from a state of separation. If we look at sin as ignorance or a state of fragmentation, then being "forgiven" means being successfully reintegrated. It is the restoration of balance.

**The Holy Spirit (Ruach)**

Ruach in Hebrew means "spirit," "wind," or "breath." The Spirit is literally what births/gives life. Ruach is grammatically feminine in Hebrew. Rucha (Aramaic) is feminine. Many early Christian authors — in particular those belonging to so-called "Jewish Christianity" — spoke of the Holy Spirit as Mother. The Greek translation for Spirit is "Pneuma," which is a neutral noun. In the Catholic Church, the Holy Spirit is referred to in English as "He." This may also point to how people relate to aspects of the All.

For this saying, in particular, it is important to understand the significance of the Holy Spirit as "Mother," "divine feminine," or feminine in nature. The Holy Spirit represents the animating life force, the inner connective tissue, the dark stillness (internal), the receptive womb of transformation. It is the subtle, internal voice of the Divine moving over the "waters" of our subconscious (see Genesis). The Father and Son (Masculine/Logos/Light) represent external manifestations of the Divine — structure, the law, the spoken word, the intellect, and the historical figure of Jesus.

Therefore, if you reject, slander, or completely close yourself off to the internal, life-giving connective force (the Holy Spirit / Divine Feminine), you are severing the very mechanism of healing and wholeness. It is "unforgivable" not because God is too angry to forgive you, but because entirely shutting out the inner connective Spirit is like locking the door from the inside.

**In Jungian Terms**

If a person purely operates from the masculine principle (intellect, logic, structure, outward action) and totally rejects the feminine principle (intuition, feeling, the unconscious, receptivity), they become rigid and fragmented. If you make a mistake in the external world (the domain of the animus), the psyche can correct it. But if you blaspheme — meaning to hold in utter contempt and deny the existence of your own unconscious/anima (the inner feminine) — you block the path to wholeness.

> *Note: In environments that overvalue the masculine, women often face intense pressure to exile their feminine essence, moulding themselves to fit a society that fails to nurture receptivity and intuition.*

**The Collective Wound**

The collective story has trampled on the feminine aspect. When cultures or religions suppress the Divine Mother, Sophia, or the Ruach, they create highly dogmatic, rigid, and ultimately destructive systems that lack empathy, inner connection, and oneness. A society that blasphemes its own feminine nature cannot find peace ("forgiveness") because it has destroyed the very principle of harmony.

Jesus' warning in Saying 44 can be read as a law of spiritual physics. You can misunderstand the external teachings (the Son) or the abstract concept of God (the Father) and still find your way back to balance. But if you fundamentally reject the inner, connective, nurturing, and transformative life-force (the Divine Feminine/Holy Spirit), you remain in a state of eternal fragmentation — "unforgiven" — because you have rejected the only force capable of making the two into one.`,

    text: 'Jesus said, "Grapes are not harvested from thorn trees, nor are figs gathered from thorn bushes, for those do not bear fruit. Good people produce good from their store. Evil people produce wicked things from their evil store within their hearts, and say wicked things. For out of the heart\'s abundance they produce wicked things."',
    reflection: `### See also: Matthew 7:15–20

This saying teaches us a valuable life lesson where one judges (knows) someone by the fruit they bear rather than by outward appearance. People are identified by the consequences of their actions ("you will know them by their fruits"), rather than their outward appearance.

One will not/cannot expect to harvest grapes from thorn trees, or gather figs from thorn bushes. These trees/bushes do not produce fruit. Therefore, it is important to discern whether a person produces from wholeness or fragmentation. It is not about judging others for being good or bad. Someone doing evil is not necessarily a malicious soul choosing the dark over the light; rather, they are acting out of ignorance of who they truly are. It is about understanding that someone who is hurt and in pain won't offer fruit from the abundance of their heart, because they have invested in pain, hurt, and suffering, and therefore deliver thorns.

Fruit is simply the visible result of the unseen root system and the health of the soil. If a tree is drawing from depleted soil — or in human terms, a storehouse of unexamined pain, resentment, or trauma — it cannot produce nourishing fruit. It produces thorns as a defence mechanism, or spoiled fruit as a symptom of internal disease. The tree is not consciously choosing to be "wicked"; the output is a direct, systemic result of what it is being fed.

The type of tree refers to the inner nature or character of a person. The fruit refers to the actions, works, teaching, or lifestyle that flow from the inner nature of the person. One won't create pain from a place of joy, gratefulness, and love.

False prophets draw attention away from our inner light. While a false prophet can be an external person, it can also be understood as a fragmented voice within ourselves. A voice of ego, fear, or unresolved pain can easily masquerade as protection or wisdom (sheep's clothing). Ultimately, however, it acts as a wolf — devouring our energy, distracting us from the quiet, grounded truth of our actual nature, and making it harder to have the energy to bear fruit.`,

But I have said: Whoever among you becomes small will know the kingdom and will be higher than John.\nJesus says: "From Adam to John the Baptist, among those who have been born of women, there is none greater than John the Baptist! But for fear that the eyes <of such a one> should be lost I have said: He who among you shall be the small<est> shall know the Kingdom and be higher than John!"',
    reflection: `John the Baptist is described as the greatest of those who came before. When Jesus mentions that John's "eyes were not destroyed"—or expresses the "fear that the eyes of such a one should be lost"—He is likely referring to the ability to see beyond the physical veil. This implies that many people have become entirely absorbed by the world (the physical plane) and can no longer access higher wisdom or consciousness. Therefore, when Jesus says "whoever becomes small," He is once again referring to becoming like a child rather than becoming like the world. This means that embracing higher wisdom and insight provides a person with the clarity to navigate life differently—learning to listen to the quiet truth of the inner kingdom rather than the noise and confusion of the external world.

The smallness is about recognizing that the answer is simple and straightforward. When we strip away the ego, the need for status, and the endless overthinking that the "world" demands of us, what remains is that quiet, straightforward truth. Children don't overcomplicate reality with hidden agendas or anxieties about tomorrow; they accept and engage with what is right in front of them. Recognizing that the deepest answers are simple is the very essence of that "smallness."`,

    text: 'Jesus said: If two make peace with one another in this one house, they will say to the mountain: Be removed, and it will be removed.',
    reflection: `When Jesus speaks of the "one house," he is talking about the temple of the self. If the internal architecture is divided against itself, the structure cannot stand, let alone move mountains. Conversely, when you do the work to build a unified internal base, your external impact naturally changes. You stop reacting from a place of unhealed wounds or an internal civil war. You are able to engage with other people, complex systems, and societal challenges with clear eyes and grounded energy. You no longer add your own unconscious chaos to the "greater whole"; instead, your internal stability becomes a stabilizing force for the environments you inhabit.

This echoes the ancient philosophical principle: "As within, so without." The work you do on your own base is never strictly personal; it is the blueprint for how you build and influence the world around you.

In psychological terms, the "masculine" and "feminine" are not about gender roles, but about modes of being. You correctly identified these through the lens of MBTI and ancient mythology:
•\tThe Masculine (Logos/Thinking): Order, logic, discernment, and the "sword" that cuts through confusion.
•\tThe Feminine (Eros/Feeling): Connection, intuition, compassion, and the "vessel" that holds and nurtures life.

When these two are at war—for instance, when logic mocks intuition, or when emotion rejects structure—the "house" is divided. This internal friction consumes all our energy. We become so exhausted by our own inner civil war that a "mountain" (a life challenge) looks insurmountable.

**Why the "Mountain" Moves**

When you achieve internal peace, the "mountain" doesn't necessarily physically vanish; rather, your relationship to the obstacle changes.
•\tFrom a Divided State: A challenge feels like an attack. You react with either pure cold logic (ignoring the human element) or pure overwhelmed emotion (losing the ability to act).
•\tFrom a Whole State: You see the challenge clearly. You use the feminine aspect to empathize and understand the root of the problem, and the masculine aspect to strategize and execute a solution.

For example, Hapi, the god of the Nile's inundation, was often depicted with both a beard and female breasts. This wasn't a statement on biology, but a symbol of fertility and total providence. To the ancients, true power and creativity required the union of both polarities. To be "one" is to be "fertile" in thought and spirit.`,

    text: 'Jesus said: Blessed are the solitary and the elect, for you will find the kingdom, for you came forth from it, (and) you will return to it again.',
    reflection: `**The hermit/sage/shaman/seer**
This text reminds me of the hermit archetype. A hermit is isolated either by the group, by circumstances (e.g., illness), or by choosing to isolate themselves.

**The Oracle or Seer:** In many ancient cultures, an individual was selected (often from youth) to serve as a conduit for information or prophecy. They were typically secluded in a temple, cave, or remote location away from the general public, only interacting when the community needed guidance.

**The Shaman:** While practices vary widely by culture, a shaman is often "called" or chosen by the community (or the spirits). Because their role requires them to navigate between the physical and spiritual worlds, they frequently live on the fringes or outskirts of the village, maintaining a necessary distance from everyday social life. This distance helps them to see clearly without being influenced by social conventions.

This isolation or solitude is where one finds the threshold (the in-between state). It is the place where the conscious and the unconscious meet. Jesus tells us that those who are alone or chosen are blessed. Interestingly, we see how solitary figures are usually chosen for certain roles in stories. Our society is conditioned to find solace and safety in groups, and many of us struggle to feel safe and good when we are on our own. Our survival instincts have taught us that it is dangerous to be alone. So, why does Jesus say that we are blessed if we are on our own? The invitation is to recognize that the inner planes—the space of solitude (stillness, darkness, void)—are where we find the kingdom.

This recognition allows us to stop seeking and thirsting after things that can never quench our thirst. A quiet room behind a closed door is a place where there is no interference or noise (if nobody is at home 😊). It is a place inside us that looks dark from the outside but contains the real truth of ourselves. When we sit with ourselves, we can hear the truth of ourselves again. This is where the shedding of false structures takes place. It is a place we fear because society has taught us to fear the quiet and the dark (i.e., the feminine). However, the dark place we go to is where the feminine and masculine meet. This restores balance.

Note: Jesus talks about the solitary and the elect. The elect can easily be viewed by the ego as meaning that someone is special or chosen because they are more important. This leads to an unfortunate cycle of jealousy and misunderstanding. For example, the *pharmakos* (a historical/sacrificial figure) was a person chosen by the community to be exiled or isolated in times of crisis to carry away the group's bad luck or guilt (i.e., the scapegoat).

**Finding the kingdom**
One will struggle to find the kingdom outside of oneself, as the world we live in often leads us away from the inner planes and tells us that everything worth having is outside of us. Learning to sit on your own with your fears, unwanted thoughts, stillness, and discomfort leads to more stability within. It helps us to make choices from a place of strength and not feel pressured when companies or others pressure us or make us feel uncomfortable. We are programmed to want to get away from feeling uncomfortable as quickly as possible, and this makes us vulnerable to predators. It is about learning to respect ourselves as whole and not fracturing ourselves for something that is not beneficial to us or others.

**Coming forth**
We have come forth from this wholeness and will return to it again. It reminds me of returning to dust again (in Genesis). Many scholars emphasize that Genesis 2:7 explicitly links the dust to the earth (*adamah*), referring specifically to local, terrestrial soil rather than cosmic debris. In Job 38:37-38, some interpretations connect *aphar* to metallic ore or dust that "sticks together," linking it to materials from the sky. For me, this returning to dust (cosmic parts) is not only about our physical bodies dying but also about returning to our fullness or wholeness.`,

It helps us to anchor/align, preventing us from getting lost in the superficial details and dualities of the world.

"Who are you?" is the question of identity. When we identify with the innate traveller instead of with the temporary labels, ego and societal roles, it allows us to interact with the world from a place of wholeness rather than insecurity or fear. This is probably why texts like these were burned or hidden as it makes people less controllable.

"What is the sign within you?" is the compass. It helps us to know how to move and when to rest. It helps us to return to balance/wholeness. Recognizing the natural cycles of action and stillness helps us to understand when we are genuinely progressing and when we are simply caught in "frantic movement" of unconscious, repetitive patterns.

The Father/the innate Self is the part of you that can't be hurt or broken by life and experiences. It stands outside of time and physical matter. It can't be controlled and it can't be killed. It is the part that doesn't change. It is the stability and the foundation of a house that can withstand life's challenges.

**Understanding movement and rest better**
Society often applauds people who are constantly busy, achieving, and moving. However, as the text points out, this can be a disguise for profound stagnation. We tend to see only one side of the coin. Constant motion is one of the most effective ways to avoid sitting with oneself. If we never stop, we never have to face our deeper wounds or ask the difficult questions or reflect on our life. A person might change jobs, relationships or cities rapidly (appearing to grow), but if they are driven by the same unhealed insecurities or unconscious patterns, they haven't actually moved an inch. When someone is in a deep depressive episode or a period of severe burnout, to the outside eye — and often the person themselves — it looks like a complete breakdown or failure to function (move). In reality the psyche and nervous system might be forcing a hard stop because the previous way of living was unsustainable. Just like a seed buried in dark soil during winter appears dead, monumental structural changes are happening beneath the surface. It is a period of intense, albeit invisible, internal recalibration.

When we apply this lens to ourselves and others, it fundamentally changes how we offer grace. If we view the "innate Self as whole," we stop judging a person's worth by their current season. We realize that the friend who seems stuck in a rut might actually be doing the hardest internal work of their life, and the colleague who never stops working might be the one who desperately needs an intervention.

This reframing requires a lot of trust in the invisible processes of the mind and spirit.

**Other interpretations**
*Mystic:*
We have come from the light of perception / self-perception / consciousness, which has self-generated from the primordial potential into the Source, our "Father." We are the sons and daughters of that Source of Consciousness, in the image of that Consciousness. We are here to act/move and to contemplate (on our actions)/rest, and thereby learn of our true nature and right way of being.

*Stevan Davies writes of 50a:*
"As all things came from the light (saying 77), so those who came from the light are distinguished not by their manner of origin but by their realization of the fact. The place in which the light came into being is the place of Gen 1:3. Because the light persists in the world as the kingdom of God, there is no idea here of a fall of the light. A person who is the restored unmanifest image of God will manifest to himself the primordial light which is upon the world (sayings 22, 24, 83, 84)."

    text: 'His disciples said to him: Twenty-four prophets spoke in Israel, and they all spoke of you. He said to them: You have abandoned the living one before your eyes, and spoken about the dead.',
    reflection: `**Texts in the New Testament that are similar:**

**John 5:37–40:** Jesus tells the religious leaders, "You study the Scriptures diligently because you think that in them you have eternal life. These are the very Scriptures that testify about me, yet you refuse to come to me to have life."

**John 8:52–53:** The authorities argue with Jesus, saying, "Now we know that you are demon-possessed! Abraham died and so did the prophets, yet you say that whoever obeys your word will never taste death. Are you greater than our father Abraham? He died, and so did the prophets."

The disciples represent a material perspective by stating that the "twenty-four prophets spoke in Israel, and they all spoke of you." When they see Jesus, they see a prophecy being fulfilled. The twenty-four prophets refer to the number of books in the Hebrew Bible (the law). When they speak about the prophets, it means that they are looking to the authority and status of those seen as having the right credentials to speak about God. It speaks to the part of us that sees hierarchy in coming from the right family, history, and status.

Jesus then says to them that they "have abandoned the living one before your eyes and spoken about the dead." It is like saying: you are looking, but you are not seeing. In Layton's translation it is clearer: "You have abandoned the one who is living in your presence, and you have spoken of those who are dead." The prophets they were discussing died long ago and had a specific role to play in society when they were alive. Jesus/the teacher notes how these old ways of thinking about God still have authority over his disciples.

If they were present to what they saw in front of them — if all the layers fell off — they would see that the presence of God was in Jesus and in them. They would recognise themselves in the mirror Jesus was showing to them. However, like most of us, they were taught to seek external authority to decide for them and to take responsibility for their lives.

The text is a reminder to stop denying ourselves and stop giving our power away — the gift that we received, our inner light — to dead things (law, status, rank, and so on) and to live from the inner light that has been inside us all along.

**Additional note — Theological parallel: The Acts of Thomas (Section 170)**

*"Since you do not believe in the living, how do you wish to believe in the dead? But do not fear. Jesus the Christ, through his great goodness, treats you humanely."*

The Acts of Thomas is an early 3rd-century apocryphal narrative — a legendary account of the Apostle Thomas's missionary journeys to India. In it, a similar rebuke is given to people who place all their faith in historical figures while remaining spiritually blind to the living, divine reality right in front of them.`,

    text: 'His disciples said to him: Is circumcision useful or not? He said to them: If it were useful, their father would beget him from their mothers (already) circumcised. But the true circumcision in the Spirit has proved useful in every way.',
    reflection: `The question: To circumcise or not? What is the intention of the question the disciples are asking? Is it to see whether Jesus confirms their beliefs, making them right and the Pharisees wrong? Is to know what the right thing is to do? The question is dualistic in nature, but Jesus sees past the question. It isn't about validating the rule; it is about redirecting the focus to the orientation of the inner life.

Jesus says that if it were important, they would be born that way already - showing the trust that Jesus had in the higher intelligence. This doesn't mean that he is now arguing for one or the other. One can easily take this text to mean that it is wrong to circumcise and miss the point. What Jesus says next is what is powerful: "[T]rue circumcision in the Spirit has proved useful in every way."

If we really want to focus on what is important, we should focus on the circumcision of the Spirit (the inner life). What is the circumcision of the spirit? It is the act of cutting away meaningless social conventions and shedding the false masks and societal expectations we wear to unearth the authentic, unfragmented true self. It is the return to wholeness.

The true self doesn't worry about social conventions and rules that isn't meaningful or useful but looks at the heart of the matter. What really fulfils you? What is important for you and what is really helping. If certain societal conventions or rules fragments you, it is better to cut it off (remove the falsities). Shedding these ingrained societal rules isn't a simple mental shift, but often a painful severing of old, comfortable identities.

One should keep in mind that these are invitations for those who are open to receive it.`,

    text: 'Jesus said: He who does not hate his father and his mother cannot be a disciple to me. And (he who does not) hate his brothers and sisters and take up his cross like me, will not be worthy of me.',
    reflection: `Similar texts in the Bible:
Luke 14:26-27
"If anyone comes to me and does not hate father and mother, wife and children, brothers and sisters—yes, even their own life—such a person cannot be my disciple. And whoever does not carry their cross and follow me cannot be my disciple." (NIV)
Matthew 10:37-38
"Anyone who loves their father or mother more than me is not worthy of me; anyone who loves their son or daughter more than me is not worthy of me. Whoever does not take up their cross and follow me is not worthy of me." (NIV)

The Threshold of Growth
There are different phases in the life cycle of a tree. A seed can lie dormant for many years and will wait for the right time to sprout. Jesus invites disciples who are ready to grow and expand further. To step into an expanded consciousness (more awareness), one must inevitably cross a threshold that separates you from the "ordinary world" of established social and familial norms. For the seeker, it usually starts with an unease or frustration with the world, society, family etc. They have questions about life, such as whether there is more to it than working or mere human existence. They struggle to fit society's mould, and this is usually when the invitation comes.

Jesus is talking about a transformative journey here (the archetypal Hero's Journey). He understood that following him would require much more from his disciples, as their family and friends might accuse them of selfishness or abandonment for the choices they make—choices that don't look like following the conventional rules of society, leading others to think they no longer care. The friction doesn't necessarily come from malice, but from a divergence in reality. When you dismantle old paradigms and expand your awareness, your very presence can become an uncomfortable mirror for those who remain bound by conventional rules. To them, your growth may look like rejection, "hate," or antisocial behaviour simply because you no longer fit the shape of the person they used to know.

Jesus' disciples may have been very eager to follow him, as he could teach them things that would open them to new possibilities and wider perspectives (which sounds exciting and adventurous). However, Jesus had already walked the path and knew that there was a naivety about following him. He knows that they won't be able to view the world in the same way once they have expanded their consciousness.

It is important to note that Jesus doesn't ask everyone to be his disciple. He chooses them with intention, and they must choose the path as well. This text should thus not be read as a failing or shortcoming if you are close to your family and love spending time with them. It doesn't mean that you are not worthy, nor does it mean that you are doing something wrong. It isn't even about leaving your family behind and never talking to them again. It is about understanding that taking this road will alter your understanding of your family and friends, and therefore, it will change family dynamics. Not everyone is ready, or meant, to dismantle their current understanding of the world. Finding joy, comfort, and deep connection within the conventional family structure is not a failure or a sign of unworthiness; it is simply a different phase of human experience.

Jesus requires his disciples to take up their cross like he did. To take up your cross is about taking responsibility for your life, making the necessary changes, and knowing that you will change and be changed in the process. The cross is not a mandate for physical martyrdom, but the ultimate symbol of radical personal responsibility. It is the heavy, solitary work of embodying what you learn. It means accepting the consequences of your own growth, knowing that you cannot unsee what you have seen, even if it permanently alters the dynamics of your most cherished relationships.`,

    text: 'Jesus said: The kingdom of the Father is like a man who had [good] seed. His enemy came by night and sowed weeds among the good seed. The man did not allow them to pull up the weeds. He said to them: Lest you go and pull up the weeds, (and) pull up the wheat with it. For on the day of the harvest the weeds will be manifest; they will be pulled up and burned.',
    reflection: `Similar text in the Bible:
Matthew 13:24–30 (NIV)
Jesus told them another parable: "The kingdom of heaven is like a man who sowed good seed in his field. But while everyone was sleeping, his enemy came and sowed weeds among the wheat, and went away. When the wheat sprouted and formed heads, then the weeds also appeared.
"The owner's servants came to him and said, 'Sir, didn't you sow good seed in your field? Where then did the weeds come from?'
"'An enemy did this,' he replied.
"The servants asked him, 'Do you want us to go and pull them up?'
"'No,' he answered, 'because while you are pulling the weeds, you may uproot the wheat with them. Let both grow together until the harvest. At that time I will tell the harvesters: First collect the weeds and tie them in bundles to be burned; then gather the wheat and bring it into my barn.'"
Food for thought: In the original context of this story, the specific weed mentioned is "darnel." In its early stages of growth, darnel looks completely identical to wheat; they can only be told apart once they mature and bear seed. This serves as a powerful metaphor: humans often cannot immediately discern between what is good for us and what is not. We must wait for things to mature before we can see their true nature.
The text: If you look at the inner life of a person who has good intentions and wants to see themselves and others thrive in a healthy, balanced manner (the good seed), the ego or external conditioning (the enemy) can often come and sow weeds among the plants that are still growing within.
The wise person does not immediately pull up these false stories or negative ideas. Doing so prematurely might uproot the good ideas, as well as the essential teachings and learnings hidden within what appears to be bad. Instead, they wait until the plants have grown. Once mature, the person can clearly discern what is "wheat" and what are "weeds."
The weeds, which are no longer useful and have served their purpose, can now be burned away. This highlights how one can extract good out of what is seemingly bad (spiritual alchemy) by allowing it time. When the day of the harvest comes, the weeds will be easy to identify and separate from what is healthy and good, leading to ultimate purification.`,

    text: 'Jesus said: "Blessed is the man who has suffered; he has found life." Alternatively: Jesus said, "Blessed is the person who has laboured and found life."',
    reflection: `Suffering is a difficult topic to discuss. Most of us have memories of times and places where we have suffered. This pain can be intense, especially when rooted in a lack of understanding. For example, we may push against something that is happening; by fighting or trying to prevent it, we only intensify and prolong our pain. Therefore, suffering is sometimes related to our unwillingness to move with the flow of life.

This is not a judgement, but simply a part of the human experience. Jesus says that the man who has suffered is blessed. Often, the world around us sees someone who is suffering as "less than," or judges them as having done something wrong. As a result, we tend to hide our pain. Revealing it can sometimes lead to further isolation, as most people are uncomfortable with suffering and want to keep it as far away from themselves as possible.

But Jesus focuses on the blessing. His perspective is profoundly different: He knows that suffering brings us back home, back to life. This does not mean we should romanticize suffering. Rather, it means we can recognize that it is not there to break us. Instead, it strips away what is unreal to point to what was always real. Ultimately, this brings us back to life, guiding us toward deeper relationships and a more profound sense of meaning.`,

Therefore, shep hise literally translates to "receiving hardship" or "taking on labor." This is why translators debate whether "suffered" or "laboured" is the more accurate English word. It implies an active, exhausting effort rather than passive victimization. In Gnostic texts, however, the paradigm is entirely different. Suffering is not a punishment or a legal transaction; it is a profound psychological and spiritual catalyst. However, Saying 58 suggests that when this inherent friction is met with conscious awareness (when it is actively laboured through, rather than blindly reacted to), it becomes the very friction needed to strike the spark of gnosis (knowledge). Suffering is the alchemical fire.'

It is the direct experience of gnosis (deep, experiential knowledge). To find life is to remember the divine spark within, stepping out of a state of spiritual forgetfulness and into luminous awareness.'

    text: 'Jesus said: Look upon the Living One so long as you live, that you may not die and seek to see him, and be unable to see him.',
    reflection: `In the context of the Gospel of Thomas and similar early wisdom texts, "death" often does not merely mean biological passing. It frequently serves as a metaphor for spiritual ignorance or a state of unconscious "sleep". To "die" without seeing the Living One is to pass through the physical existence entirely asleep to the divine reality around you.

**The deferred life syndrome**

We are culturally conditioned to treat the present moment merely as a stepping stone to a better future—whether that future is a vacation, retirement, or the afterlife. Saying 59 radically challenges this by suggesting that the divine (and true joy) is only accessible in the eternal now. If we practice missing the present moment our whole lives, we will inevitably lack the capacity to see it at the end.

Mainstream traditions often emphasize *believing* in a historical figure (e.g. no longer living) or *waiting* for a future event (e.g. the second coming). Saying 59 shifts the focus entirely from passive belief to direct experience. The "Living One" is an active, present reality that requires the practitioner to "look upon" and engage with it actively while they have the breath to do so.

We tend to live in the past or for someday, in the future. We tend to be anywhere but here. We tend to live for weekends or events (getting married, getting the job etc.). We are not present to what is in front of us now. We often speak about how we miss those that have passed. However, when they are living next to us, we are not present. This is part of the tragedy of having this gift of life and not seeing it.

The Living One can be interpreted as seeing God/The All in everything. However, we miss that God is with us, in us and all around us now. We can live with him now. To experience with joy and wonder all that is now.`,

    text: '<They saw> a Samaritan carrying a lamb, who was going to Judaea. He said to his disciples: (What will) this man (do) with the lamb? They said to him: Kill it and eat it. He said to them: While it is alive he will not eat it, but (only) when he kills it (and) it becomes a corpse. They said to him: Otherwise he cannot do it. He said to them: You also, seek a place for yourselves in rest, that you may not become a corpse and be eaten.',
    reflection: `Some Jews viewed Samaritans with deep hostility, regarding them as religious heretics, social outcasts and "half-breeds". When Jesus introduces a Samaritan, it usually signals to the listener that expectations are about to be subverted, forcing the disciples to look at the situation with fresh eyes (not with preconceived ideas/judgements). 
A Samaritan carries a lamb. The lamb may feel a false sense of security in the Samaritan's arms, yet the disciples know it is being carried to its death. The lamb is unaware of the fact that he is being taken to be killed. Jesus's use of the word "corpse" invites us to pause and redefine life and death. The striking use of the word "corpse" blurs the line between the living and the dead. A person can be physically alive but entirely asleep, passively carried toward their own destruction—rendering them a corpse long before their physical end.
When Jesus says "seek a place in rest," he is talking about anchoring yourself in your divine, eternal nature. In the ancient world, there was a heavy philosophical focus on the hierarchy of nature—what eats what. In Thomas, the spiritual realm must consume the physical (transforming it into spirit), otherwise, the physical realm will consume the spirit. If you do not establish your "rest," you become part of the food chain of the material world. When we come to rest in what we really are, we are no longer pulled in all directions. It becomes easier to discern. 
Practically, it comes down to not being consumed by the modern drive for busyness, which keeps us spiritually asleep. When we lack awareness, our time, energy, and very identity is "slaughtered" and consumed by external forces (work, societal expectations, digital noise). It comes back to rest and movement.
If we are always active in the world (e.g. think about the drive to be busy), we become like a corpse. We don't recognize that we are being slaughtered, because we are only focused on working. Ultimately, it comes down to the balance between rest and movement—both are essential. Rest allows us to receive and become deeply aware of what we are doing and why. This clarity makes our actions more intentional and protects us from being consumed by external forces.`,

    text: `Jesus said, "Two will rest on a bed: the one will die, and the other will live." Salome said, "Who are you, man, that you ... have come up on my couch and eaten from my table?" Jesus said to her, "I am he who exists from the undivided. I was given some of the things of my father." "I am your disciple." "Therefore I say, if he is destroyed, he will be filled with light, but if he is divided, he will be filled with darkness."`,
    reflection: `**Authority born from "Gnosis", Not Hierarchy**

In the orthodox church, authority was strictly hierarchical (bishops, priests, apostolic succession) and male-dominated.

In this text, Salome sits at the dinner table with Jesus and participates. Salome questions Jesus' authority to teach when he says that "two will rest on a bed: the one will die, and the other will live."

In Gnosticism, authority is derived entirely from gnosis (direct, experiential inner knowing). Jesus has authority because he has realized his connection to the "undivided" source. Salome has the authority to sit at the table, question him, and declare herself his disciple because she possesses the spiritual maturity to recognize that truth. When the physical world (and its gender roles) is viewed as an illusion, spiritual equality becomes the natural default.

To understand this text, we have to understand a different cosmology than the one that we were taught.

**The Original Wholeness:** Before the physical universe existed, there was only the ultimate, undivided source — often called the Monad or the Pleroma (Divine Fullness). In this state, there are no opposites. There is no male or female, no life or death, no light or dark. Everything exists as a singular, perfect, androgynous whole.

**The Fracture into Duality:** In Gnostic thought, the creation of the material world wasn't a triumph; it was a cosmic error or a fall from grace. The physical universe is inherently fractured. To exist in the material world is to be trapped in the "split" of binaries. The material realm operates on division — you cannot have physical life without physical death, or up without down.

Then Jesus continues his teaching telling us something that sounds counterintuitive: if "he is destroyed, he will be filled with light, but if he is divided he will be filled with darkness." In traditional frameworks, destruction is seen as the ultimate negative — punishment or death. But in this cosmology, what must be "destroyed" is the illusion of separation.

Depending on the translation of the original Coptic text, the word for "destroyed" is sometimes translated as "empty" or "desolate." It means to be emptied of the divided ego, the societal labels, and the binary identities (male/female, rich/poor, master/servant). Only when that separated, dualistic state "dies" can the original, undivided light rush in.`,

        definition: `The New Testament portrays Salome as a relatively minor figure — she appears briefly in the Gospel of Mark as one of the women at the crucifixion and as a "Myrrhbearer" who visits Jesus' empty tomb. However, in Gnostic and early apocryphal traditions, Salome is dramatically elevated. She emerges as a prominent, inner-circle disciple who engages Jesus in deep theological dialogue. In these texts, she isn't just a follower; she is a seeker of esoteric knowledge who helps illustrate some of the core tenets of Gnosticism — particularly the rejection of the physical world and the spiritual unification of opposites.`

    text: `Jesus said: I speak my mysteries to those [who are worthy of my] mysteries. What your right hand does, let not your left hand know what it does.`,
    reflection: `**Similar text in Bible:** Matthew 6:3 — "But when you do a charitable deed, do not let your left hand know what your right hand is doing."

In the Gospel of Matthew, the core mechanism of the teaching is about bypassing the ego. When we do things to be loved, admired, or even to "go to heaven," our ego acts as an internal accountant. The "left hand" is watching the "right hand" to keep score. Ultimately, it comes down to not seeing others as us. When we view people as separate entities to "help," our actions become a way to feel superior or earn praise. One can easily read Matthew and think, "Well, as long as I don't brag about it when I do nice things for others, I am a good person." We may stop there and miss the gold.

The text in the Gospel of Thomas does strip away the external context of almsgiving. Why? In Gnostic texts, the goal is not moral perfection, but divine oneness (wholeness) through lived experience. So how is it possible for us to not know what our right hand does? The answer is to stop doing and return to wholeness. By saying the left hand shouldn't know what the right is doing, it points to a state of action where the "doer" disappears. The act of kindness simply flows through you as a natural expression of what is, rather than a transaction you are orchestrating for personal gain.

When we realize that we are one with the Source of all things, we recognize that there is no separation. Separation makes us split things, like giving alms, into separate categories (i.e., something we should do). This creates the very division we are trying to avoid in the first place. By pairing "I speak my mysteries to those who are worthy" directly with the metaphor of the hands, the text implies that the ultimate spiritual mystery is the state of undivided oneness. You cannot understand the "mysteries" intellectually; you can only experience them when you stop causing division within yourself.

When we are whole and we live our lives, we give and receive all the time without knowing it.

**The Ancient and Modern Mind**

While the ancients living in the 1st century didn't understand neurobiology or brain hemispheres, they used "right" and "left" as universal metaphors for profound dualities: conscious and unconscious, light and dark, male and female, spirit and matter.

When the logical, analysing self (right hand—left brain) and the intuitive, connected self (left hand—right brain) are no longer separated, you achieve a state of flow.

It was never about alms. It is about living fully. When you are in a state of wholeness, you don't try to do good; good simply happens through you because you no longer view yourself as separate from the person next to you.`,

    text: `Jesus said: There was a rich man who had many possessions. He said: I will use my possessions to sow and reap and plant, to fill my barns with fruit, that I may have need of nothing. Those were his thoughts in his heart; and in that night he died. He who has ears, let him hear.`,
    reflection: `**Similar text in the New Testament:** Luke 12:13–21.

The story is told about a "rich man" – an archetype. It is someone we can all recognize. If we define this archetype as anyone who uses external accumulation — whether that's money, status, accomplishments, or even knowledge — to build a fortress against the unpredictability of life, the "shoe fits" almost everyone at some point. This is why the text needn't scare us but can invite us to look deeper.

Ways we tend to interpret the text when we look at it through the eyes of our ego: we are scared that Jesus is talking about us, so when we hear the story, we focus on the fact that the man is rich and then hear: "Oh, don't worry — I am not rich, so this isn't applicable to me. I don't have that much so I am okay." Strangely enough, it is still the same mindset that creates the problem. When we live as separated people, we confuse having with being. We start seeing the things around us as possessions — things to attain. We start focusing on having enough to never worry about anything or anyone. We become producers and consumers of things and therefore we see a need to obtain to be safe or to remain ahead of the curve. We avoid living. There is no judgement in this. But what is the text inviting us to see? What is the gift?

We are looking at someone who has identified with having and possessing as something that makes them secure and whole. It is the idea of "I am what I have." The story takes a turn when the man's plan doesn't come to fruition as he died before he got to experience what he wanted. Interestingly, the text refers to the thoughts that were in his heart — pointing to the fact that there wasn't space for something more than having and possessing. His anxieties ran his life.

We then encounter the familiar invocation: "He who has ears, let him hear." Far from a simple concluding remark, this phrase acts as an invitation for deeper reflection. It signals that the narrative operates well below the surface, quietly challenging the reader: if this resonates with your own experience, sit with it, internalize it, and let its deeper truth unfold. On the surface, we may hear the message to not think that we will be safe if we possess everything, or that we will be condemned for being rich. The issue isn't that the man is rich or that he plans. The issue isn't that he lives comfortably. The message doesn't speak to our ego. It speaks to our wholeness.

There is a misunderstanding about our physical experience when we argue as the rich man does. The rich man wasn't rich at all if you listen closely. He was seeing scarcity and created from that scarcity. That is why he needed to sow and reap and plant, and to fill his barns with fruit — it helped him to feel more whole, more secure. But there is no mention of relationships with others or really enjoying nature. He was plagued by scarcity.

What did the rich man actually have in the end? Nothing. He died without ever experiencing the life he desired, simply because he was always saving it for a future that never arrived.

So then the question becomes: what are we working towards? When we understand life to be something to overcome or to survive, we don't live — we start possessing, competing, stressing, and splitting things. But a person who is truly whole doesn't seek riches, because they are already rich. They are not what they own, as they don't need to possess to feel whole. Their beingness and not their doingness makes them experience life in a deeper, more meaningful sense. The world is then not something to consume, but something for relationship, for living, for experiencing. The tragedy doesn't lie in the fact that the man was rich — it lies in what was really going on beneath the surface.

When we argue the way the rich man does, we are saying that happiness or fulfilment lies somewhere outside of us, or somewhere in a future event. The future event never comes, and we are still in lack.`,

    text: `Jesus said: "Show me the stone which the builders rejected; it is the cornerstone."`,
    reflection: `This verse is interesting. It reminds us of the Bible text in which Peter is called the stone on which the church is built.

> **Matthew 16:18**
> And I tell you, you are Peter [Greek, Petros—a large piece of rock], and on this rock [Greek, petra—a huge rock like Gibraltar] I will build My church, and the gates of Hades (the powers of the infernal region) shall not overpower it [or be strong to its detriment or hold out against it]. (AMPC version)

Here, we get the chance to let the text speak for itself. It is stripped of its context, and it allows us to sit with it and think for ourselves. So, the first question which comes to mind is: who are the builders?

Well, one only has to think about one's lived experience to know which information is valued by society and what is being fought against or rejected. Some ideas/keys that could help people were withheld from them, as it would empower them in such a way as to no longer conform to controlling forces in the same way. This meant that that information was dangerous for the existing rulers or those who wanted to remain in power/control. It was, therefore, important for some people to provide a narrative/a foundational story that would keep people tethered to a certain frame and make them easier to be controlled.

However, if one builds on a weak cornerstone (one that is built on fear, greed, or control), it cannot last. It tells us something about structures and how they function. It helps us to see that some structures aren't built to last. This allows us to look for the rejected keys/words that offer a cornerstone that can really provide stability when storms come our way.

If we, for example, believe that we are sinners and need saving, we will create that narrative, and when the storms hit, we will wait for someone to save us — remaining in a state of fear, victimhood, or even anger if nobody shows up. However, when we recognize that we are the sons and daughters of the living Father, we reclaim our sovereignty and true origin. We no longer see the ocean as something that will destroy us, but as something that *is* us, and we learn to swim and move in a different way through life. We stop fighting the systems and recognize that we are not the systems that we try to keep there for safety, as they were never meant to last and never meant to protect like we may have thought at one time.

**Definition: Cornerstone**
A cornerstone was the critical first stone laid during construction. It determined the level, angle, and orientation for the entire structure. If the cornerstone was slightly off, the entire building would be structurally unstable and could eventually collapse. Beyond its physical necessity, the cornerstone held deep cultural, spiritual, and astronomical significance.

- **Cosmic Orientation:** Ancient builders in Egypt, Mesopotamia, and the Levant laid buildings according to precise astronomical points, and the cornerstone established this vital compass orientation.

### Traditions and Interpretations
**1. The Greek vs. Aramaic Language Distinction**
The linguistic debate centres heavily on the shift in gender between the two Greek words used in Matthew 16:18.

**The Greek Wordplay**
In the original Greek text of Matthew, the sentence reads: "You are Petros (masculine), and on this petra (feminine) I will build my church."

- **Petros (Πέτρος):** A masculine noun typically meaning a detached stone, pebble, or boulder.
- **Petra (πέτρα):** A feminine noun meaning a massive, immovable bedrock cliff or mountain ridge.

Protestant apologists historically argued that Jesus used *Petros* for Peter to show he was just a small stone, but *petra* to show that the church's true foundation was Christ Himself or Peter's faith.

**The Aramaic Reality**
However, Jesus and his disciples spoke Aramaic as their daily language. Matthew's Greek gospel is a translation of those spoken words. In Aramaic, there is no distinction between a small stone and a bedrock cliff for this word; both are Kepha (כֵּיפָא). The underlying Aramaic statement would have sounded like this:

"You are Kepha, and on this kepha I will build my church."`,

    text: `Jesus said: "He who knows the all, (but) fails (to know) himself, misses everything." (Blatz)\n\nJesus said: "If anyone should become acquainted with the entirety and should fall short of all (?), that person falls short utterly." (Layton)`,
    reflection: `This text reminds us of the text: "When you come to know yourselves, then you will become known, and you will realize that it is you who are the sons of the living father. But if you will not know yourselves, you dwell in poverty, and it is you who are that poverty."

This is the key – the kingdom is within. One will feel "less than," betray yourself, perform and identify with what is small, and live on the surface. This means that you are not rooted in deep soil, and therefore you will also be more prone to being smothered by weeds or falling over. Going within is like growing a big root system and breaking the hard soil down, so that new life can be born and grow. It helps us to become more flexible throughout the changes that life brings and helps us to understand that who we are is not a problem to be solved or fixed, but that we are the sons of the living Father.

Here is a metaphor that will make it more clear: When we treat the world around us and our world within as enemies, we behave like a virus in the system, and the system doesn't recognize us. However, when we recognize ourselves, the system recognizes us (think of resonance), and it therefore doesn't see us as a threat, but as part of the harmonious whole.

The requirement is not that we go within and lie to ourselves. It is to go within, shine a light on what is there: the fear, the pain, the shadows, and things we try to hide because we think that we will be rejected. But we have rejected ourselves, and in rejecting ourselves, we also reject what is outside of us. When we look for the truth outside of us, we only see reflections, and reflections aren't the real/full truth of ourselves, so we still feel like something is amiss.

### Some Bible verses that are similar:
Psalm 18:25 shows some of the reflectiveness of the outside world, which we sometimes mistake for the whole: "With the merciful You will show Yourself merciful; With a blameless man You will show Yourself blameless."

Matthew 7:21-23:

> 21 "Not everyone who says to me, 'Lord, Lord,' will enter the kingdom of heaven, but only the one who does the will of my Father who is in heaven. 22 Many will say to me on that day, 'Lord, Lord, did we not prophesy in your name and in your name drive out demons and in your name perform many miracles?' 23 Then I will tell them plainly, 'I never knew you. Away from me, you evildoers!'"

This verse also points to how surface-level ways of living don't recognize the full picture and think that we can somehow trick the system to see how good we are by doing "good" things.

The world is sometimes obsessed with the information age. It tells us what knowledge is important/makes one important. However, Source doesn't measure in the same way. When pretense falls, we get to know ourselves, and when knowing ourselves, we are known (not necessarily by people around us), but we acknowledge our divinity and oneness with all, and we are recognized within the greater system.

The sheep that leaves (that is seen as lost) is found eventually. The prodigal son finds out that the life with his father meant more than the life lived on the surface and is welcomed home. His father recognizes him, and he recognizes his father. The son returns as someone who sees and knows why he wants to return home.`,
